# projecting-app

## üìù Description
Projecting is an easy and intuitive application, its purpose is to provide to beginner developers with a tool to support them during the development of a project.
After entering the project information, you can monitor your progress and view the main activities.
It isn‚Äôt intended for big project and neither for experienced developers, who may need and advanced managing tool.

## üéØ Purpose
The problem is that when a beginner developer starts with a new project, doesn‚Äôt know how to organize it.
Despite the amount of project management softwares available, no one of them is at the same time easy and useful.
Inexperienced developers often face this situation, and don‚Äôt know how to deal with it.
There are a lot of software that offer simple tool for small projects management, like to do lists, more or less advanced.
Those softwares are helpful only for small project, but don‚Äôt help the inexperienced developer in no way.
In fact, as far as  advanced the to-do list is, a beginner doesn't know how to use it to schedule his job.
